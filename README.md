# Space-Debris
The Space Debris Management Project tackles the growing concern of space debris orbiting Earth, which poses significant risks to satellites, spacecraft, and the long-term sustainability of space exploration. With over 20,000 pieces of debris currently in orbit, the potential for collisions is becoming a serious issue. This project aims to develop a comprehensive system for tracking, predicting, and mitigating these risks through advanced data management and predictive modeling techniques.

At the heart of this project is the creation of a sophisticated database designed to efficiently store and retrieve crucial information on space debris. By combining conventional database methodologies with modern technologies, this system enables real-time updates and rapid access to key data. Predictive algorithms are integrated into the system to analyze the trajectories of space debris and assess potential collision risks, offering automated solutions to avoid such collisions. The project also features visual analytics, implemented using Python, to provide mission planners and space agencies with clear insights into debris movement and risks.

The technical backbone of the project includes the use of MySQL for managing relational data and MongoDB for handling more complex NoSQL queries, ensuring flexibility and scalability in managing the vast amounts of data involved. By enhancing real-time debris tracking and developing algorithms for collision avoidance, the Space Debris Management Project contributes to the sustainable use of Earthâ€™s orbital space, making it safer for future space activities.
